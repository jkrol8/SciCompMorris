In his original design, Morris suggested a method that creates r trajectories consisting of (k+1) points from the input space. Each trajectory can be used to calculate k elementary effects, one for each input factor. This section explains how we can obtain a set of these trajectories that allows for efficient evaluation of elementary effects."
